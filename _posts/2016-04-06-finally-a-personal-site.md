Hosting a personal site instead of using common blogging platform has been in my mind for a while. Before this [github page] is built there were several options for me to get what I want. Instead of searching themes available I would like to make it my own. In fact, [Wordpress](www.wordpress.com) was my first way came in mind to have a blogging site. Then, thanks to my friend Eric, he suggested his still-no-update-for-2-months blog's blogging engine - [ghost](https://ghost.org/) and it is really simple and people could make any customizations. However there is a problem as I need to deal with Nodejs that I considered to be the next few things to get on to but not now. After spent an afternoon installing nodejs on my mac and go through some tutorials I decided to have other appoach to build my site: [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a template engine that process posts of markdown format and produce static html pages. The whole project deal with no database which is a lot different from any other common blogging platform out there. For me to decide to move on to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) based on the following reasons:

- Github host your project/blog for free!
- Use favourite Markdown language to write posts locally on computer and post it by git commits
- Structure is simple so that customizations is on your own choice.

Setting up a [Github page](https://pages.github.com/) is simple and many great resource out there to help setting up in couple minutes. For me I followed these sites to simply make my site to go live!

After setting up the site, migrating my posts from [Wordpress](www.wordpress.com) and writting post to try out the workflow all seemed pretty good. However, There are some cons of using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) like there are limited plugins for it and learning additional markup language is necessary to custom site or try to make your site more dynamic. As [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)'s appoach to make static content is kind of going backward but the good thing is it encourages to focus on the contents. Which is a good reason for me to use it although I may need to spend more time to thrill into [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). There are good resources to help to craft my own site and since [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) is open-sourced I can benefit from all other jekyll sites on the net. Here are some hacks and helpful resource I would like to credit to:

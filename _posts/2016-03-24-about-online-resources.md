This post was supposed to be here the last monday which was exactly 2 weeks later since my last post. However, I accidently discarded the editing and I couldn’t rewrite once again..shame. What I wanted to say was that I found blogging is quite hard for me as I don’t use to write so taking time to think what to write and telling story are not easy task for me. But I still need and want to do it, so..let’s start with what I have been doing since my last post.

As mentioned in last post I started reviewing basic unix syntax and the next things was going to review Ruby. To start with reviewing Ruby I went to the official ruby site and looked for online tutorial. As I have learned it once in the past so I thought the major goal for me was pick up those knowledge fast. I chose [ProgrammingRuby](http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/) as the starting point and spent 2-3 days studying prior to moving on to rails.

After the studying I tried to look for online tutorial for learning rails. At that moment [Udemy](www.udemy.com) was offering $19 a course for all course available so I chose to enroll two course:

- [Python Tutorial: Python Network Programming – Build 7 Apps](https://www.udemy.com/python-programming-for-real-life-networking-use/)
- [The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/)

Having invested money could make me feel guilty if I did not really take benefit from them. So far I am making progress on the rails for that Rails course but I decided to use the python course later as I found some other way to start python with, and i will get to that very soon.

When I was studying ruby I realized that the major thing I got was all about syntax and I really thought that I need practical programming problems to enhance the ability to think. At that time my brother told me that he was about to have exam for his python computing course in 1 week. An idea popped up that it may be a good chance for me to go for learning python and I may help my brother a little bit if he needed. But I didn’t want to start the python course i paid in [Udemy](www.udemy.com) as it seems like providing you ways to hack the task but not really scientific as I thought that I needed to train my brain to think. Therefore I alternatively enrolled a free online course in [Udacity](www.udacity.com) called “Introduction to computer science”. I don’t really need to be intro-ed once again but the idea was about having some programming tasks and learning python. It took me another 3-4 days to work on the problem sets provided and I enrolled another few course on [Udacity](www.udacity.com) after that! There is one program that [Udacity](www.udacity.com) offers called Nanodegree. It combines several free courses into the program and the main benefits is that people will get 1-1 mentoring and project review on the subject they enrolled. It costs about $199USD and people would get half money back when they complete the course in a year. Sounds great. But for me? I don’t really want to pay money for courses that seem to be able to enroll for free. Python seems like powerful in scientific purpose especially data science. And I want to work with my friends on some project using python. So I decide to enroll some course that I interested which is a part of the nanodegree program. They mostly related to data analysis.

Oh..It’s time to have lunch as my mum is yelling at me not having lunch. Next time I will talk more about some ideas that I want to start with showcasing my work. Gotta make the progress countable.

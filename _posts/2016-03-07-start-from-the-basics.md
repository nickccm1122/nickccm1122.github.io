As I could barely remember most of the knowledge of any computing skills. I need to start all over again. The bright side is that I don’t really need much time to pick up all those knowledge. Today I have started from the Unix commands mostly related to OX system startup configs, some practical file manipulations, vi commands. I will be keep working on some practical tasks like bulk files modification, creating scripts, extracting information from the web, etc. After those I think it would be enough to move on to taking some online course getting back to programming language. I will be focusing on Ruby first and maybe python if necessary. Some more area I should get familiar with very quickly like Git controls, and I would like to learn D3.js, Angular.js and Node.js afterwards.

Besides, getting back to computing is not the only goal I have set. Since I came back to Hong Kong I kept waking up early and had workout everyday. Having workout everyday makes me feel..great.. running out of words. Second, I have tried to read 1 english book a week and my ultimate goal is to read 2 books a week. I don’t used to read in my life but keep reading and become a speed reader are my current goals on the list.

Ok, time to have dinner now and read afterward, stay determined every single day!
